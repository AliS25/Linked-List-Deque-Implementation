# Linked-List-Deque-Implementation
An implementation of the Deque ADT: DLLDeque.java, which implements SimpleDeque using a doubly linked list.
Also there is a program that tests the performance of the implementation. Specifically, it measures the (average) running times of the SimpleDeque operations for a range of instance sizes.
